# 🧠 Learning Notes

This repository contains personal learning notes, diagrams, and summaries on various technical topics I explore during my development journey. The notes are primarily structured and maintained using [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/), with visual models created using the [Excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com/) plugin.

## 📂 Structure

The vault is organized into the following types of content:

- **📘 Notes**: Written explanations, research, and summaries on topics like software architecture, design patterns, clean code principles, database modeling, and more.
- **📊 Diagrams**: Visual representations such as EER diagrams, UML class diagrams, flowcharts, and system designs using Excalidraw.
- **🧪 Experiments**: Trial ideas, thoughts, and problem-solving breakdowns for projects I’m currently working on.

## ⚙️ Tools Used

- **[Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/)**: A powerful knowledge base that works on top of a local folder of Markdown files.
- **[Excalidraw Plugin](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin)**: Enables freehand drawing inside Obsidian for diagramming.
- **Markdown**: For clean and portable text-based note-taking.
- **GitHub**: To version control and share the notes publicly.
